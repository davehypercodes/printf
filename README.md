# Printf project
This repository contains David and Jecolia's ALX printf project.

## Reason For Building This Project
Building The printf project covers the application of a whole lot of concepts in C programming, As a result it is important to review and know how the printf function  works so that we can grasp these concepts better and apply them in building a bigger and more complex project.

## About Printf
`Printf` stands for "print formatted" which really explains what it does; it is used to printf formatted strings which is basically "text" + "Format specifiers" which starts with the `%` character. The format specifiers act as placeholders for some additon we want to use to format our text to give it more meaning like contents of a variable. The text is usually enclosed within double quotes.

### Format Specifiers
Here are some of the most common format specifiers that define the format of the display of arguments as text to stdout.

| Format Specifier |               Usage            	      |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
|	`%c`	   | printing a single char 	     	      |
|	`%s`       | Printing a String of Characters 	      |
|	`%d`	   | Printing a Decimal Number (signed int)   |
|	`%u`	   | Print an a Decimal Number (Unsigned int) |

The `printf` has a lot of more interesting attributes that make it special and good to grasp some important concepts in C programming. This README just touches the surface of what the printf project is all about.
